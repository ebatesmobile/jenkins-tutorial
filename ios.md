# Jenkins Pipeline setup for iOS ðŸ“±

Here at Ebates for iOS continuous integration and deployment, we are using Jenkins which has been working quite well! In this guide, we will be going over the following:

1. Setting up GitHub and Jenkins webhooks
2. Creating new items(formerly known as jobs) on Jenkins
3. Creating declarative pipeline script, a.k.a Jenkinsfile

### Environment

- Jenkins 2.89.3
- Xcode 10.0

### 1. Setting up GitHub for Jenkins webhooks

Your Jenkins server and GitHub will need to be able to communicate to each other in order for a pull request to trigger a build. To do that, let's go to GitHub first to set that up.

1. Go to your repository at github.com
2. Choose `Settings` (If you don't see this option, your admin needs to provide access)
3. Choose `Webhooks` from the left pane
4. Click on `Add webhook` button

5. Add your Jenkins server address with `github-webhook` path. e.g. `http://example.com/github-webhook`
6. Choose `Let me select individual events.` and check `Pushes` and `Pull requests`

Now let's configure Jenkins' webhook.

1. Go to the Jenkins top page and click on `Manage Jenkins` > `Configure System` > `GitHub`
2. `API URL` should be `https://api.github.com`
3. Choose correct credentials. To add new one, go to `Jenkins` > `Credentials` > `System` > `Global Credentials` > `Add Credentials`.
4. Check `Manage hooks`
5. Click on `Advanced`
6. Check `Specify another hook URL for GitHub configuration` and enter the address you entered above. e.g. `http://example.com/github-webhook`

### 2. Creating new Item on Jenkins

1. Go to your Jenkins server and click on `New Item`
2. Give it a name and choose `Multibranch Pipeline`
3. Under `Branch Sources` type in the repository owner username in `Owner` field. Then, you'll be able to select your repository in `Repository` dropdown menu
4. In `Behaviors` section, delete everything else and only have `Discover pull requests from origin`. This section can be customized to your needs
5. In `Build Configuration` section by default, the pipeline script name is specified as `Jenkinsfile`
6. Use this sample script for the `Jenkinsfile`
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
      stages {
          stage('Setup') {
              steps {
                echo "Hello world!ðŸ‘‹"
              }
          }
      }
}
```
7. Create a new pull request with this script and your Jenkins machine should detect it and start running the script


### 3. Creating declarative pipeline script: The Jenkinsfile

Pipeline scripts are responsible for defining what your Jenkins item will do for each build. For this guide, we will:

- Clone the repository
- Build an iOS project
- Run unit test
- Notify build status by email

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build and Test My App') {
            steps {
                script {
                  sh "xcodebuild -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace \
                    -scheme MyApp \
                    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone X,OS=12.0' \
                    clean test"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        success {
            script {
                emailext (subject: "âœ… Success",
                   body: "Build URL: ${BUILD_URL}",
                   to: "your@email.com")
            }
        }
        failure {
            script {
                emailext (subject: "ðŸš« Fail",
                   body: "Build URL: ${BUILD_URL}",
                   to: "your@email.com")  
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That should cover the basics for setting up the iOS continuous integration using Jenkins! ðŸŽ‰

This tutorial just covers the basics, you can integration with services like Slack for messaging.

If you have more than one pipeline and want to re-use some methods from common methods, you can follow this documentation: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/

Good luck!
